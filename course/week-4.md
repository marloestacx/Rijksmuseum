## 1. Manipulate, filter and sort data (Monday)

To be able to view the data that you have loaded from an API in a more targeted way, add a filtering and sorting component to your web app. To properly filter and sort the data, it is useful to store data locally. for example in LocalStorage or simply in an object that is part of your app. With the map, filter and reduce methods you always retrieve the desired data and display it in the interface.

## 2. Code splitsen in modules (Monday)

If all goes well, your app is now almost ready. Refactor your code to individual modules (these should more or less correspond to the actors from your actor diagram), so that your code is more manageable. Put the modules in separate files.
